### 1.5 Overview
This SAD includes all the necessary architectural details of the project MyCookieBook. It contains a database diagram, that gives an overview about the structure of the project. Also architectural representation and goals are represented in this document.

## 2. Architectural Representation
Our web application is build using Java, Angular, SpringBoot in the frontend and Eva in the backend. 
IDE we use: JetBrains IntelliJ

Languages:
- Frontend: Java, Angular, SpringBoot
- Backend: Java
- Testing: Juni. Mockito
